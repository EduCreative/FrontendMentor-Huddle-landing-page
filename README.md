## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Desktop-First

### What I learned

Swtiching from Desktop to Mobile is far easier than vice versa. But I think it depends on the design.

### Continued development

I need to design more of these challenges to get comfortable different types of designs.

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.W3school.com) - This helped me for recalling syntax of different CSS statements.
